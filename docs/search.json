    "text": "Morbidities can pave the way for mortality. As morbidities increase, so do mortality and the risks that are associated with pregnancy. These include “chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, pregestational diabetes mellitus, and previous preterm birth, and lower rates of tobacco use” (Gulersen et al., 2022, p. 1). Chronic diseases like these are quickly becoming more prevalent in the United States (Bodenheimer et al., 2009). This is scary because, with the addition of multiple comorbidities, there is an increased risk of mortality. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality associated with pregnancy and childbirth increased and it was shown that the rates of in-hospital deaths had increased (Simeone et al., 2021). However, it is hard to say if they were caused by COVID-19 or by the confounding effects that the coronavirus has on pre-existing conditions in pregnant women. Unfortunately, many of these comorbidities come with their friends. As a person ages, they become more susceptible to the snowball effect of these chronic diseases. Smith also found that “pregnant women with 3 underlying health conditions had over twice the risk of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 illness compared with those with no comorbidities” (Smith et al., 2023, pg. 163). Although little research has been done to establish cause, it is reasonable to think that comorbidities could be playing a key role in the deaths of pregnant women during the pandemic.\nIn a study done by Simeone and colleagues, it was revealed that deliveries in 2020 had a higher chance of death. There were 53 in-hospital deaths, while in 2019, there were 33, an increase of 69%. When the researchers in this study removed the women who had COVID-19 during labor, this number was no longer significant, meaning that COVID-19 had a significant role in the increase in deaths from 2019 to 2020 (Simeone et al., 2021). But why is this happening? COVID-19 can be considered a comorbidity and increases the severity of preexisting conditions. The women who died also had preexisting comorbidities that exacerbated the symptoms of COVID-19, to the point where they became deadly. The coronavirus takes over its host’s respiratory system. Because every bodily function requires the use of oxygen and energy, it becomes extremely hard for bodies that are already dealing with preexisting conditions to fight off COVID. Then when you add another body, sharing resources with its mother, a pregnant woman is fighting to get enough nutrients and oxygen to supply both her and the fetus. Women with a COVID-19 diagnosis had higher rates of pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia/eclampsia. Because of this, pregnant people were highly recommended to strictly abide by all COVID-19 prevention measures throughout the pandemic (Villar et al., 2021) to reduce the risk of maternal mortality. Those who were already dealing with diabetes, hypertension, being overweight, cardiac diseases, and chronic respiratory diseases were at a higher risk for complications from COVID-19. A study done by Smith and colleagues revealed that for those with a positive coronavirus test, the “risk of mortality was 3.79 times higher for pregnant women with preexisting diabetes mellitus, 2.75 times higher for those with preexisting hypertension, and 16.75 times higher for those with cardiovascular disease compared to those without these chronic health conditions” (Smith et al., 2023, pg. 166). As the prevalence of these diseases is increasing, and there are new mutations of COVID-19 emerging, the risk of maternal mortality could continue to rise. These comorbidities are also heavily influenced by social determinants of health, with the prevalence increasing as factors like socioeconomic status, food security, race, and more are involved. In the next blog post, we explore the key interactions between comorbidities, SDOHs, and state COVID-19 policies."

    "title": "Blog Post 3: Social Determinants of Health",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Social determinants of health (SDOHs) are the unchangeable aspects of a person’s life that directly affect their well-being (Braveman, 2023). These include race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, age, and location. By having a different skin tone, or by being born in certain neighborhoods, people suffer the consequences of systematic disadvantage. SDOHs can have a direct impact on the health of an expecting person. For example, women of color are subjected to racism within medical communities and are often left feeling unheard by providers (Villarosa, 2018). Another example includes hospital funding: if a pregnant woman lives in an affluent area, the closest hospital to her is likely to be stocked with the best providers and resources available.\nBefore COVID-19, the US already had disappointing maternal health statistics. The country had the highest percentage of maternal mortality and morbidity for a developed nation (MacDorman et al., 2017). Trost and colleagues focused on pregnancy-related deaths from 2017-2019 and found race, ethnicity, age, education level, and location were major factors for maternal mortality. Those who are underserved and less privileged are at a higher risk of death, with many of these deaths being preventable (Trost et al., 2022). About 84.2% of the pregnancy-related deaths that occurred in the US between 2017 and 2019 were considered preventable (Trost et al., 2022).\nTo further understand preventability, let’s talk about race. Due to systematic oppression and low levels of trust in the medical system, black women have a higher incidence of stress during pregnancy (Villarosa, 2018). This lack of trust stems from not feeling heard by providers and therefore not receiving an adequate level of care. Stress can raise blood pressure, disrupt hormones, and put the body into a state of fight or flight. All these stress responses factor into the development of comorbidities that can be deadly during pregnancy. These additional morbidities then cause adverse maternal and infant health outcomes like low birth weight and maternal conditions like pre-eclampsia, which can lead to deathly outcomes like uterine bleeding and seizures. Those with a lower socioeconomic status also have a higher incidence of poor birthing outcomes. This can be due to a lack of insurance, being unable to pay hospital bills, not being able to afford prenatal care, or the health problems associated with having a low SES (Blumenshine et al., 2010). One of these health problems is obesity. Obesity caused by low SES stems from food insecurity. Typically, nutritious foods are more expensive than highly processed and sugary options. This leaves many families’ only options being fast food or skipping meals altogether. When all a person can afford is food that does not provide any real nutrition, it is easy to become obese. Also, when people are struggling to make ends meet, it is incredibly hard to find the time to exercise. If an expecting woman is trying to work two jobs, she most likely does not have time to sneak in a walk or go to the gym. When considering these factors, we can consider obesity as an outcome of SDOHs. Obesity can lead to complications in pregnancy and birth because it increases the risk of developing preeclampsia and other blood pressure-related disorders. The conditions that cause obesity are what lead to maternal mortality in some cases. In 2019, one study identified that 12.7% of mothers were obese; this study further revealed that 33 women died (Simeone et al., 2021). Using these numbers, we can estimate that about 4 of these women were obese. COVID-19 disproportionately affected people of color and those with low socioeconomic status. This is mainly because the pandemic widened gaps that were already existing within our medical system. In a study done by Metz and colleagues, five women who died due to pregnancy-related complications had tested positive for COVID-19 at the time of death (Metz et al., 2022). Although there is evidence of increased risk, there is no evidence to suggest a concrete link between COVID and pregnancy-related death. It does, however, reveal the interaction between symptoms of COVID-19 and how women are treated within our healthcare system. People of color are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. The higher prevalence in the minority community stems from barriers to accessing PPE supplies, misinformation, and distrust in the medical system (Tai et al., 2021). These reasons compounded with the SDOHs that outdate the pandemic, made these groups more susceptible to infection. People of color also have a higher risk of negative birth outcomes due to systematic racism. Though race did not have statistical significance in this study, vulnerable groups are already marginalized within the birthing world (Metz et al., 2022). The multiplicative effect of the increased prevalence of coronavirus in people of color and the proven negative birth outcomes on moms of color, show a scary correlation of the indifference in the US medical system. This is setting people up to die. This study was conducted before many of the COVID-19 variants began to spread but it would be valuable to see how pregnant women of color were affected by the more infectious and deadly variants of the virus.\nIn March 2020, New York City saw a higher number of new mothers admitted to the ICU. These women were COVID-19-positive and obese. Because the coronavirus makes the respiratory and circulatory systems work overtime, those with increased blood pressure and reduced lung capabilities, suffer more severe symptoms. These women had to be intubated during delivery and experienced preterm births (Khoury et al., 2020). As discussed earlier, obesity is often a consequence of having low SES. Obesity was associated with COVID-19 severity which was in turn associated with the likelihood of receiving a C-section or preterm birth. Those with severe COVID-19 were more likely to deliver via Cesarean Section. There were no maternal deaths in this study but a lot of scary outcomes. C-Sections are major surgeries that come with many risks of their own, including “risks from anesthesia, blood loss, infection, a longer recovery period and potential for a higher risk of postpartum depression” (C-Section vs. Natural Birth, 2021). New mothers cannot lift more than fifteen pounds, find comfortable breastfeeding positions that do not interfere with their incision site, and will have to seek pain management (Changes to Expect after a C-Section, n.d.). As COVID-19 continues to mutate, it is important to know how obese, pregnant women will react to the disease because mutations could become deadlier to those dealing with increased blood pressure.\nWhat is clear is how powerful the social determinants of health are in relation to pregnancy and health, specifically maternal and infant health. The next blog post will focus on the effects of comorbidities on pregnancy and COVID-19."

    "title": "Blog Post 1: Defining and Measuring Maternal Mortality Before and During COVID",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Before you jump in and begin the blog, here is a list of key terms that are crucial to understand:\n• Maternal Mortality: The World Health Organization defines maternal mortality as, “female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy” (Indicator Metadata Registry Details, n.d.).\n• Maternal Morbidity: “any health condition attributed to and/or aggravated by pregnancy and childbirth that has negative outcomes to the woman’s well-being” (What Are Maternal Morbidity and Mortality? | Office of Research on Women’s Health, n.d.).\n• Preventable Death: means that “there was at least some chance of the death being adverted by one or more reasonable changes to patient, community, provider, facility, and/or systems factors” (Trost et al., 2022, pg. 5).\n• Maternal Mortality Rates: the number of pregnancy-related deaths divided by the total number of maternal deaths in each state.\nA lot can be said about the overall health of a nation based on the health outcomes of its most vulnerable populations: women and children. When a nation does not take proper precautions to guarantee protection from the fatality of its vulnerable populations, they are not providing citizens with adequate resources of life. The United States is a developed country that is struggling with maternal mortality. In the US, about 700 women die every year from pregnancy-related complications, which is more than in any other developed nation (What Are Maternal Morbidity and Mortality? | Office of Research on Women’s Health, n.d.). While this statistic is heartbreaking, it is even more shocking when we realize that about half of these deaths are deemed preventable. This became incredibly clear throughout the COVID-19 pandemic as the effects of social determinants of health and comorbidities were worsened by the symptoms of coronavirus.\nAs of early 2024, little research has been done to see if the pandemic had a major effect on the rates of adverse maternal health outcomes in the United States. It is particularly important to know how major public health events shape the lives of our nation’s mothers and their children. This project will look at the research that has already been done and aim to decipher how, where, and why COVID-19 is affecting pregnant women in America. The blog posts will examine the pandemic’s effect on maternal mortality.\nTo understand the overarching idea of this blog, it is important to know how maternal mortality is measured in the United States. Since 2003, maternal mortality has been reported via the U.S. standard death certificate where a box is checked off to “ascertain whether the female decedents were not pregnant within the past year, pregnant at the time of death, not pregnant within 42 days of death, not pregnant but pregnant 43 days to 1 year before death, or unknown if pregnant within the past year” (MacDorman et al., 2017). These checkboxes are believed to be a flawed system because it is susceptible to human error. This can underestimate the number of maternal deaths in a year. Boxes that were supposed to be marked could be forgotten or the cause of death could be wrong, therefore leaving a maternal death unmarked. Because of the imperfect system, new policies are suggesting that “Hospitals and systems should improve death certificate quality through medical certifier training and support. Medical schools should consider making this education a requirement for completion of medical school. The CDC offers a guide for completion of medical certifications of death” (Brown & Canzoneri, 2021). Maternal death review committees serve to look at the cause of death and to use that information to prevent future deaths from happening. Because COVID-19 is a pressing public health issue, some states are pushing to review deaths during this period faster to see if there is a connection to the pandemic. Pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, already factors for more severe COVID-19, also have an impact on pregnant women that could have a multiplicative effect on the adverse outcomes. We need to understand if the death was caused by COVID-19 or a comorbidity that was exaggerated by the effects of the coronavirus (Metz et al., 2020).\nLater in the blog, I will visually represent the maternal mortality rates throughout the country. This will be done by analyzing data compiled by MuckRock. MuckRock is a nonprofit journalism organization that gathered CDC data based on death certificates (MuckRock/Maternal-Mortality: A Repository of CDC National Center for Health Statistics Maternal Mortality Data and a Selection of State Data, from Michigan, Minnesota and North Carolina, about Maternal Deaths, n.d.). By using this dataset, I was able to map different mortality rates from both before and after the pandemic. These mortality rates represent the number of pregnancy-related deaths divided by the total number of maternal deaths in each state. These maps provided me with a base for researching different COVID-19 policies per state and their maternal health policies.\nThe risk of maternal mortality increases when societal influences play a role in health care, preexisting conditions complicate pregnancy, and new pregnancy-related (maternal) morbidities further hinder a pregnant person from a healthy gestation. In the next post, I will examine how comorbidities of health impact maternal mortality, both before and during the pandemic."
