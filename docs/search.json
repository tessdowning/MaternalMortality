The author is Tess Downing, a senior at St. Lawrence University studying Statistics and Public Health. Follow along to learn about how maternal mortality is measured and reported, and how social determinants of health and pre-existing comorbidities shaped how pregnant people’s health outcomes were affected during the peak of the pandemic."

    "text": "Section 1: Mapping Maternal Mortality by State Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Arkansas had the highest rate of maternal mortality at 62%. Illinois had the lowest rate of maternal mortality with 15%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Alabama had the highest rate of maternal mortality at 60%. Illinois had the lowest rate of maternal mortality with 14%. Arkansas had a rate of 38% which is not great but a large improvement from the previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce COVID-19 hit in 2020, we can see a difference in the coloring of the map, centered around the South Eastern States. Tennessee had the highest maternal mortality rate at 69%. Pennsylvania had the lowest rate at 19% which is higher than the lowest states the previous two years. Arkansas is ranked second highest in this first pandemic year with 62% maternal mortality, almost double what it was in 2019. Alabama came in third with maternal mortality rate of 59%, one percent less than the year prior. Illinois saw an increase to 28% this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 hit new highs all over the country for maternal mortality rates. Alabama is back to number one with a shocking maternal mortality rate of 86%. California had the lowest rate with 23%, the highest low value we have seen so far. Illinois rate crept up to 36% with Pennsylvania right behind it with 35%. Arkansas saw a rate of 67% and Tennessee had another shocking rate of 75%."
