Hi and welcome to the GitHub page for my blog on the effects of COVID-19 on maternal mortality in the United States. 

This blog was created for my Senior Year Expereience project at St. Lawrence University in Canton, NY.

The graphics and data analysis used in this blog were created using data complied by MuckRock in their maternal-mortality GitHub page:

For the health of all mothers and babies!
